# 🚗 Automobile Dataset Analysis

## 📊 Overview
This project serves as the capstone for the Data Analysis Bootcamp, designed to demonstrate the full range of data analytics and visualization skills developed throughout the course. The objective is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the automobile.txt dataset to uncover meaningful insights about vehicle performance, pricing, and manufacturer trends.

## 🎯 Project Tasks
- Create a working copy of the provided Capstone_Project_template.ipynb notebook as `automobiles.ipynb`
- Load and clean the dataset by:
  - Removing duplicate rows and entries with missing values
  - Converting data columns to appropriate data types
  - Ensuring the dataset is properly formatted for analysis
- Conduct detailed data exploration and generate visualizations that summarize key findings
- Export a final EDA report as **"EDA Report – Automobile Dataset.pdf"**, explaining all visualizations, investigations, and conclusions

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Fuel Efficiency vs. Price**: The cheapest cars show significantly better fuel efficiency than the most expensive ones — even the least efficient model among cheaper cars outperforms the most efficient luxury car.
- **Top Fuel-Efficient Manufacturers**: Chevrolet leads with over 40 MPG, followed by Isuzu, Honda, and Volkswagen, each averaging around 34 MPG.
- **Engine Capacity**: The vehicles with the largest engines are produced by Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW.
- **Model Variety**: Toyota dominates the dataset with the highest number of models (over 30), followed by Nissan and Mazda.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📁 Deliverables
- Cleaned and processed `automobiles.ipynb` notebook
- PDF report: **EDA Report – Automobile Dataset**
- Visual summaries highlighting key trends and correlations
